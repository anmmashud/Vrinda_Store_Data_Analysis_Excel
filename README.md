### 🧰 Data Cleaning:
1. **🔢 Transforming the data into a table:**
   The data was turned into a table to enable filters and make it easier to analyze. (You can also activate filters using **Alt + D + F**, but tables are more reliable.) ✨✨✨

2. **🧠 Checking for anomalies:**
   I checked for blank or null cells. Luckily, none were found. If there were any, they would have been ❇ excluded using the filter options. ✨✨✨

3. **🏛️ Standardizing gender entries:**
   The gender column had inconsistent entries (Men, M, W, Women). These were standardized into two categories: **Men** and **Women**. ✨✨✨
