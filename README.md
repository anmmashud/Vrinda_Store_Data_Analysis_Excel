### Collecting Data:

The original data is provided in the file named **"Vrinda_Store_original.xlsx"**.

### Sample Questions:

Here are some sample questions to guide the analysis:

1. Compare sales and orders using a single chart.
2. Which month had the highest sales and orders?
3. Who purchased more—men or women—in 2022?
4. What were the different order statuses in 2022?
5. List the top 10 states contributing to the sales.
6. What is the relationship between age and gender based on the number of orders?
7. Which sales channel contributed the most to sales?
8. Which category had the highest sales?

### Data Cleaning:

1. **Turning the data into a table**: I selected the first cell and converted the data into a table to enable filters. This helps check all values within the columns. (Alternatively, you can turn on filters using the shortcut **Alt + D + F**, but I do not recommend this method for consistency.)
   
2. **Checking for unwanted cells**: I checked for any blank or null cells. Fortunately, I did not find any issues. If any had been found, I would have unselected them from the filtering dropdown.

3. **Standardizing the gender column**: The gender column had four different values (Men, M, W, Women). I standardized them into two categories: Men and Women.

### Data Processing:

As per the requirement for the second sample question, I added a new column to extract the month from the Date column.
